                <br> 1. Rabindranath Tagore born Robindronath Thakur, (7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941), and also 
known by his sobriquets Gurudev, Kabiguru, and Biswakabi, was a Bengali polymath, poet, musician, 
and artist from the Indian subcontinent. He reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian 
art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, 
fresh and beautiful verse" of Gitanjali, he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature
in 1913. Tagore’s poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and 
magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as "the Bard of 
Bengal". As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, 
sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in the 
institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University. 
<br> <br>2. Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. 
His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and 
personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are 
his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their 
lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two 
nations as national anthems: India’s Jana Gana Mana and Bangladesh‘s Amar Shonar Bangla. The Sri 
Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work. 
Early life: 1861–1878
<br> <br>3. The youngest of thirteen surviving children, Tagore (nicknamed "Rabi") was born on 7 May 1861 
in the Jorasanko mansion in Calcutta to Debendranath Tagore (1817–1905) and Sarada Devi (1830–
1875). 
<br> <br>4. Tagore was raised mostly by servants; his mother had died in his early childhood and his father 
travelled widely. The Tagore family was at the forefront of the Bengal renaissance. They hosted the 
publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of Bengali and Western classical music featured there 
regularly. Tagore’s father invited several professional Dhrupad musicians to stay in the house and 
teach Indian classical music to the children. 
<br> <br>5. Tagore largely avoided classroom schooling and preferred to roam the manor or 
nearby Bolpur and Panihati, which the family visited. His brother Hemendranath tutored and physically 
conditioned him—by having him swim the Ganges or trek through hills, by gymnastics, and by practising 
judo and wrestling. He learned drawing, anatomy, geography and history, literature, mathematics, Sanskrit, 
and English—his least favourite subject. Tagore loathed formal education—his scholarly travails at the 
local Presidency College spanned a single day. 
<br> <br>6. After his upanayan (coming-of-age) rite at age eleven, Tagore and his father left Calcutta in 
February 1873 to tour India for several months, visiting his father’s Santiniketan estate and Amritsar before 
reaching the Himalayan hill station of Dalhousie. There Tagore read biographies, studied history, 
astronomy, modern science, and Sanskrit, and examined the classical poetry of Kālidāsa. During his 1-
month stay at Amritsar in 1873 he was greatly influenced by melodious gurbani and nanak bani being sung 
at Golden Temple for which both father and son were regular visitors. He wrote 6 poems relating to Sikhism 
and a number of articles in Bengali child magazine about Sikhism. 
<br> <br>7. Tagore returned to Jorosanko and completed a set of major works by 1877, one of them a long 
poem in the Maithili style of Vidyapati. As a joke, he claimed that these were the lost works of newly 
127
discovered 17th-century Vaiṣṇava poet Bhānusiṃha. Regional experts accepted them as the lost works of 
the fictitious poet. He debuted in the short-story genre in Bengali with "Bhikharini" ("The Beggar Woman"). 
Published in the same year, Sandhya Sangit (1882) includes the poem "Nirjharer Swapnabhanga" ("The 
Rousing of the Waterfall").
Santiniketan: 1901–1932
<br> <br>8. In 1901 Tagore moved to Santiniketan to found an ashram with a marble-floored prayer hall—
The Mandir—an experimental school, groves of trees, gardens, a library. There his wife and two of his 
children died. His father died in 1905. He received monthly payments as part of his inheritance and income 
from the Maharaja of Tripura, sales of his family’s jewellery, his seaside bungalow in Puri, and a derisory 
2,000 rupees in book royalties. 
<br> <br>9. In November 1913, Tagore learned he had won that year’s Nobel Prize in Literature: the Swedish 
Academy appreciated the idealistic—and for Westerners—accessible nature of a small body of his 
translated material focused on the 1912 Gitanjali: Song Offerings. He was awarded a knighthood by King 
George V in the 1915 Birthday Honours, but Tagore renounced it after the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh 
massacre.
<br> <br>10. In 1921, Tagore and agricultural economist Leonard Elmhirst set up the "Institute for Rural 
Reconstruction", later renamed Shriniketan or "Abode of Welfare", in Surul, a village near the ashram. With 
it, Tagore sought to moderate Gandhi’s Swaraj protests, which he occasionally blamed for British India’s 
perceived mental — and thus ultimately colonial — decline. He sought aid from donors, officials, and 
scholars worldwide to "free village[s] from the shackles of helplessness and ignorance" by "vitalising 
knowledge". In the early 1930s he targeted ambient "abnormal caste consciousness" and untouchability. 
He lectured against these, he penned Dalit heroes for his poems and his dramas, and he campaigned—
successfully—to open Guruvayoor Temple to Dalits.
Death
<br> <br>11. Tagore spent the last four years of his life in sickness and pain. In late 1937, he lost consciousness. 
He was in a coma for a long time. Eventually he woke up, but three years later, he went back into a coma. 
During these years, whenever he was conscious and felt well enough, he wrote poems. These poems talk 
about how he came close to death. After a long period of suffering, Tagore died on 7 August 1941, at the 
age of 80, in his childhood home in Kolkata
