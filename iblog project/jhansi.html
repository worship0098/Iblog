            <br> 1. Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi; (19 November 1828 – 18 June 1858), was the queen of
            the princely state of Jhansi in North India currently present in Jhansi district in Uttar Pradesh, India.
            She
            was one of the leading figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and became a symbol of resistance to
            the British Raj for Indian nationalists.
            Early Life
            <br><br> 2. Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November 1828 in the town of Varanasi into
            a Marathi family. She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu. Her father was Moropant
            Tambe and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from Maharashtra. Her mother
            died when she was four years old. Her father worked for a court peshwa (one of 8 ministers
            under Chhatrapati) of Bithoor district. The peshwa called her "Chhabili", which means "playful". She was
            educated at home and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included
            shooting, horsemanship, fencing and mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tatya
            Tope.
            <br><br>  3. Rani Lakshmibai was accustomed to riding on horseback accompanied by a small escort between
            the palace and the temple although sometimes she was carried by palanquin. Her horses included Sarangi,
            Pavan and Baadal; according to historians she rode Baadal when escaping from the fort in 1858. The Rani
            Mahal, the palace of Rani Lakshmibai, has now been converted into a museum. It houses a collection of
            archaeological remains of the period between the 9th and 12th centuries AD.
            History of Jhansi, 1842 - May 1857
            <br><br>  4. Manikarnika was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Raja Gangadhar Newalkar, in May 1842 and
            was afterwards called Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai) in honour of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi and according to
            the traditions. She gave birth to a boy, later named Damodar Rao, in 1851, who died after four months.
            The Maharaja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao’s cousin, who was
            renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja died. The adoption was in the presence of the
            British political officer who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing that the child be treated
            with
            respect and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime.
            <br><br>  5. After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was
            an adopted son, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied
            the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao’s claim to the throne and annexing the state to its
            territories.
            When she was informed of this she cried out "I shall not surrender my Jhansi" (Main meri Jhansi nahi
            doongi). In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave
            the palace and the fort.
            Siege of Jhansi
            123
            <br><br> 6. From August 1857 to January 1858, Jhansi under the Rani’s rule was at peace. The British had
            announced that troops would be sent there to maintain control but the fact that none arrived strengthened
            the position of a party of her advisers who wanted independence from British rule. When the British forces
            finally arrived in March they found it well-defended and the fort had heavy guns which could fire over the
            town and nearby countryside. Hugh Rose, commanding the British forces, demanded the surrender of the
            city; if this was refused it would be destroyed. After due deliberation the Rani issued a proclamation: "We
            fight for independence. In the words of Lord Krishna, we will if we are victorious, enjoy the fruits of
            victory,
            if defeated and killed on the field of battle, we shall surely earn eternal glory and salvation." She
            defended
            Jhansi against British troops when Sir Hugh Rose besieged Jhansi on 23 March 1858.
            Flight to Gwalior
            <br><br> 7. The leaders (the Rani of Jhansi, Tatya Tope, the Nawab of Banda, and Rao Sahib) fled once more.
            They came to Gwalior and joined the Indian forces who now held the city (Maharaja Scindia having fled to
            Agra from the battlefield at Morar). They moved on to Gwalior intending to occupy the strategic Gwalior
            Fort and the rebel forces occupied the city without opposition. The rebels proclaimed Nana
            Sahib as Peshwa of a revived Maratha dominion with Rao Sahib as his governor (subedar) in Gwalior. The
            Rani was unsuccessful in trying to persuade the other rebel leaders to prepare to defend Gwalior against
            a British attack which she expected would come soon. General Rose’s forces took Morar on 16 June and
            then made a successful attack on the city.
            Death
            <br><br>  8. On 17 June in Kotah-ki-Serai near the Phool Bagh of Gwalior, a squadron of the 8th (King’s Royal
            Irish) Hussars, under Captain Heneage, fought the large Indian force commanded by Rani Lakshmibai,
            who was trying to leave the area. The 8th Hussars charged into the Indian force, slaughtering 5,000 Indian
            soldiers, including any Indian "over the age of 16".They took two guns and continued the charge right
            through the Phool Bagh encampment. In this engagement, according to an eyewitness account, Rani
            Lakshmibai put on a sawar’s uniform and attacked one of the hussars; she was unhorsed and also
            wounded, probably by his sabre. Shortly afterwards, as she sat bleeding by the roadside, she recognised
            the soldier and fired at him with a pistol, whereupon he "dispatched the young lady with his
            carbine". According to another tradition Rani Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi, dressed as a cavalry leader,
            was badly wounded; not wishing the British to capture her body, she told a hermit to burn it. After her
            death
            a few local people cremated her body. Her tomb is in the Phool Bagh area of Gwalior.
