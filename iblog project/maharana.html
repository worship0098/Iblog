              <br>  1. Pratap Singh I (9 May 1540 – 19 January 1597) popularly known as Maharana Pratap, was the 
                13th Rajput king of Mewar, a region in north-western India in the present day state of Rajasthan.
                Early life and accession
               <br> <br>  2. Maharana Pratap was born in a Rajput family. He was born to Udai Singh II and Jaiwanta Bai. He 
                was married to Ajabde Punwar of Bijolia. He belonged to the Royal Family of Mewar, which was also related 
                to the Royal Family of Saurashtra, Gujarat. 
              <br> <br>   3. After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but 
                senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed.
                Battle of Haldighati
               <br> <br>  4. The bloody Siege of Chittorgarh in 1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to 
                the Mughals. However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom was still under the control of the Rana. 
                The Mughal emperor Akbar was intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap 
                Singh was crowned king (Rana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys entreating the Rana to become a 
                vassal like many other Rajput leaders in the region. When the Rana refused to personally submit to Akbar, 
                war became inevitable. 
               <br> <br>  5. The Battle of Haldighati was fought on 18 June 1576 between Maharana Pratap and Akbar’s forces 
                led by Man Singh I of Amer. The Mughals were victorious and inflicted significant casualties among the 
                Mewaris but failed to capture Maharana. The site of the battle was a narrow mountain pass 
                at Haldighati near Gogunda, modern day Rajsamand in Rajasthan. Maharana Pratap fielded a force of 
                around 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. The Mughals were led by Man Singh of Amber, who commanded 
                an army numbering around 5000-10,000 men. After a fierce battle lasting more than three hours, Maharana 
                found himself wounded and the day lost. The mughal were unable to capture him. He managed to escape 
                to the hills and lived to fight another day. The casualties for Mewar was far more, 1600 men to 100 men of 
                the Mughal army with another 350 wounded. 
                120
               <br> <br>  6. Haldighati was a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to capture Maharana Pratap, 
                or any of his close family members in Udaipur.
              <br> <br>   7. As soon as the empire’s focus shifted north-west, Pratap and his army came out of hiding and 
                recaptured the western regions of his dominion.
                Resurgence
              <br> <br>   8. Mughal pressure on Mewar relaxed after 1579 following rebellions in Bengal and Bihar and Mirza 
                Hakim’s incursion into the Punjab. In 1582, Maharana Pratap attacked and occupied the Mughal post at 
                Dewair (or Dawer). In 1585, Akbar moved to Lahore and remained there for the next twelve years watching 
                the situation in the north-west. No major Mughal expedition was sent to Mewar during this period. Taking 
                advantage of the situation, Pratap recovered Western Mewar including Kumbhalgarh, Udaipur and 
                Gogunda. During this period, he also built a new capital, Chavand, near modern Dungarpur. 
                Death
              <br>  <br>  9. Reportedly, Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident at Chavand on 19 January 1597, 
                aged 56. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Amar Singh I. 
              <br>  <br>  10. Rana Pratap’s defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput 
                states, constitute a glorious saga of Rajput valour and the spirit of self sacrifice for cherished principles. 
                Rana Pratap’s methods of sporadic warfare was later elaborated further by Malik Ambar, the Deccani 
                general, and by Shivaji Maharaj.
