                <br>1. Tipu Sultan was born on 20 November 1750 at Devanahalli, in present-day Bangalore Rural 
district, about 33 km north of Bangalore city. He was named "Tipu Sultan" after the saint Tipu Mastan Aulia 
of Arcot. Being illiterate, Hyder was very particular in giving his eldest son a prince’s education and a very 
early exposure to military and political affairs. From the age of 17 Tipu was given independent charge of 
important diplomatic and military missions. He was his father’s right arm in the wars from which Hyder 
emerged as the most powerful ruler of southern India. 
<br> <br>2. Tipu’s father, Hyder Ali, was a military officer in service to the Kingdom of Mysore who had become 
the de facto ruler of Mysore in 1761 while his mother Fatima Fakhr-un-Nisa was the daughter of Mir Muinud-Din, the governor of the fort of Kadapa. Hyder Ali appointed able teachers to give Tipu an early 
education in subjects like Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Kannada, Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, riding, shooting 
and fencing. 
Early military service
<br> <br>3. Tipu Sultan was instructed in military tactics by French officers in the employment of his father. At 
age of 15, he accompanied his father against the British in the First Mysore War in 1766. He commanded 
a corps of cavalry in the invasion of Carnatic in 1767 at age 16. He also distinguished himself in the First 
Anglo-Maratha War of 1775–1779. 
Second Anglo-Mysore War
<br> <br>4. In 1779, the British captured the French-controlled port of Mahé, which Tipu had placed under his 
protection, providing some troops for its defence. In response, Hyder launched an invasion of the Carnatic, 
with the aim of driving the British out of Madras. During this campaign in September 1780, Tipu Sultan was 
dispatched by Hyder Ali with 10,000 men and 18 guns to intercept Colonel Baillie who was on his way to 
join Sir Hector Munro. In the Battle of Pollilur, Tipu decisively defeated Baillie. Out of 360 Europeans, about 
200 were captured alive, and the sepoys, who were about 3800 men, suffered very high casualties. Munro 
was moving south with a separate force to join Baillie, but on hearing the news of the defeat he was forced 
to retreat to Madras, abandoning his artillery in a water tank at Kanchipuram. 
<br> <br>5. Tipu Sultan defeated Colonel Braithwaite at Annagudi near Tanjore on 18 February 1782. 
Braithwaite’s forces, consisting of 100 Europeans, 300 cavalry, 1400 sepoys and 10 field pieces, was the 
standard size of the colonial armies. Tipu Sultan seized all the guns and took the entire detachment 
prisoner. In December 1781 Tipu Sultan successfully seized Chittur from the British. Tipu Sultan had thus 
gained sufficient military experience by the time Hyder Ali died on Friday, 6 December 1782 . 
<br> <br>6. Tipu Sultan realised that the British were a new kind of threat in India. He became the ruler of 
Mysore on Sunday, 22 December 1782, in a simple coronation ceremony. He then worked on to check the 
advances of the British by making alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The Second Mysore War 
came to an end with the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore. 
Third Anglo-Mysore War
<br> <br>7. In 1791 his opponents advanced on all fronts, with the main British force under Cornwallis taking 
Bangalore and threatening Srirangapatna. Tipu harassed the British supply and communication and 
embarked on a "scorched earth" policy of denying local resources to the invaders. In this last effort he was 
successful, as the lack of provisions forced Cornwallis to withdraw to Bangalore rather than attempt a siege 
of Srirangapatna. Following the withdrawal, Tipu sent forces to Coimbatore, which they retook after a 
lengthy siege. 
<br> <br>8. The 1792 campaign was a failure for Tipu. The allied army was well-supplied, and Tipu was unable 
to prevent the junction of forces from Bangalore and Bombay before Srirangapatna. After about two weeks 
of siege, Tipu opened negotiations for terms of surrender. In the ensuing treaty, he was forced to cede half 
his territories to the allies, and deliver two of his sons as hostages until he paid in full three crores and thirty 
lakhs rupees fixed as war indemnity to the British for the campaign against him. He paid the amount in two 
instalments and got back his sons from Madras. 
Death
126
<br> <br> 9. Three armies marched into Mysore in 1799—one from Bombay and two British, one of which included 
Arthur Wellesley. They besieged the capital Srirangapatna in the Fourth Mysore War. Thus, the soldiers in 
the British force numbered more than 50,000, whereas Tipu Sultan had only about 30,000. The 
British broke through the city walls, and French military advisers told Tipu Sultanto escape via secret 
passages, but he refused.
<br> <br> 10. Tipu Sultan was killed at the Hoally (Diddy) Gateway, which was located 300 yards (270 m) from 
the N.E. Angle of the Srirangapatna Fort. He was buried the next afternoon at the Gumaz, next to the grave 
of his father.
